# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous middleware.  The server doesn't gracefully handle errors thrown within asynchronous operations, leading to silent failures.  The solution shows how to properly implement error handling using a centralized error handler or try...catch blocks.
